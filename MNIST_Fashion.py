    dataset is a popular choice for testing and comparing machine
    learning algorithms, particularly those suited for image classification. 
    \nRelatively small size: With 70,000 images, it's computationally efficient to train and 
    test on, making it ideal for initial experimentation and algorithm evaluation.
    \nSimple image format: 
    The images are grayscale and low-resolution (28x28 pixels), 
    simplifying preprocessing and reducing computational demands.
    \nMultiple classes: 
    It consists of 10 distinct clothing categories, allowing you to assess 
    the classifiers' ability to differentiate between various categories.
    \nBenchmarking: 
    As a widely used dataset, it facilitates comparison of your models' 
    performance with established benchmarks for these algorithms on the same dataset."""
